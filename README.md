## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to create a simple QR Code Page dedicated to flashing the QR code for easy access to my website. Users should be able to view a centralized responsive container showcasing the QR code wide and clear, along with guidance text below for instructions on how to use it.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/qr-code-page_frontend.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is the first project that I am making and is the most basic project ever. This project has helped me practice the most fundamental and simple concepts of HTML and CSS like making div responsive across all devices and I also got to learn about resetting CSS which is mentioned in the code snippet below-

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  align-items: center;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  font-family: "Outfit", serif;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}

.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 40px hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  padding: 4%;
  top: 25%;
  text-align: center;
  width: 375px;
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
